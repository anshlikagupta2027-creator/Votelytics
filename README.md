VOTELYTICS

Election Candidate Win–Loss Prediction System

This project is a Machine Learning–based prediction system designed to analyze election data and estimate the win–loss probability of a candidate. By entering a candidate's name, the system retrieves the candidate’s past electoral details and predicts their winning percentage, losing percentage, and provides key insights about their profile and performance.

 Key Features

•	Candidate Lookup — Accepts candidate name as input

•	ML-Based Prediction — Predicts win/loss percentage using modeled election data

•	Candidate Profile Display — Shows candidate’s history, party, constituency, and performance metrics

•	Trained on Realistic Election Data (historical patterns, candidate attributes)

•	Interactive UI — Easy-to-use interface (Jupyter Notebook/Ipywigdets)

•	Model Evaluation — Includes accuracy scores and evaluation reports

Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of Machine Learning in political analytics, showcasing how historical voting patterns and candidate attributes can be leveraged to forecast electoral outcomes.

 How It Works
 
1.	User enters the candidate’s name

2.	System fetches corresponding record from dataset

3.	ML model processes candidate features

4.	Output displays:
 
 o	Win probability
 
 o	 Loss probability
 
 o	 Candidate profile + details
